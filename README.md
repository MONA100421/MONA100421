### 🧠 My Journey

I started with a **business and information management background** in Taiwan 🇹🇼,  
which gave me strong foundations in strategy and data thinking.  

Now at USC, I am transforming into a **software engineer and machine learning practitioner**,  
crafting solutions that scale from **big data pipelines** to **deep learning models**.  

I believe in combining **business sense + technical execution** to create real-world impact.
